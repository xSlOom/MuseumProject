# MuseumProject

This project has for goal to get the informations of a specific museum with his address, number phone, city from a database.

We are using :
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://materializecss.com/">Material Design</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://php.net">PHP</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/?hl=fr">Google Map API</a></li>
</ul>

to build this project. All files needed are uploaded on this Github. (Even the .sql ^_^)

The images registered in the database may be under copyright so be careful if you are going to use it on a server. (Yes, we got it from <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>.)

If you have any questions or issues, feel free to open a new issue on the top.
